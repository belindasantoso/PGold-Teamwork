Hi, first of all, great website overall, I really like the color scheme which was mainly blue to represent AI. 

However, I think the only thing that I am confused was the Summary part, just because it was lacking the colors and the images, the background etc. 
Also, at the other pages, it says Summary but when I clicked on the page, the header says Evaluation, so it is a bit confusing for me. 

I personally like both the disadvantage and advantage pages the most, just because I think that it really highlights the AI part 
with all the images used and the colors. The home page was also quite good, but I think it would be better if there are more "AI Elements" in the home page. 

For the summary page, maybe try to make it into a few paragraphs? so it doesn't feel too crowded while reading. And also maybe try adding a background
and some images would be a great way to spice up the page in my opinion.

Anyways, good job guys! :)
